## A micro-framework for publishing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown "Markdown")

The author of Markdown, [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/ "Daring Fireball"), has remarked:

**Zapdown!** aims to make publishing Markdown simple by letting you forget about HTML as a publishing format altogether.  **Read, write, edit and publish prose.**

You can read more [about Zapdown!](/about "About Zapdown!") and how to quickly get it up and running for yourself.
