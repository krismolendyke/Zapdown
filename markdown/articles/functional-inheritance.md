# Functional Inheritance

* Singleton pattern- just use an object literal!

## Closure
* A function object contains two things that make it a *closure*:
    1. A function with name, parameters & body
    1. A reference to the environment in which it was created, or a *context*

## Modules vs. Functions
* In JavaScript, since functions have scope, they can be used to create 'modules'.
* Variables defined in functions are only visible to that function.
* Therefore, functions can be used as *module containers*.
